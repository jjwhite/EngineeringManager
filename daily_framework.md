## People

- Does anyone need feedback today?
- Hiring: do I need to look for candidates or follow up with any?  Always move quickly.

## Administrative
- Are there any messages, emails, tags that I need to follow up on?
- Does the backlog need grooming?
- Expense reports, training, reports, compliance tasks?
- Monitoring - does anything need monitoring right now?

## Decisions

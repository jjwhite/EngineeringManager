# Engineering Manager Framework

This is my personal repository of learnings associated with being an Engineering Manager for a medium-sized silicon-valley tech company.  It is meant to be a set of living documents that will grow and change as I learn and experience more in this role.

## My Background

I was an IC (Individual Contributer) for over 15 years prior to becoming a manager.  I worked on the full application stack including mobile applications during my time as an IC.  The transition to Engineering manager has been challenging but often rewarding.
